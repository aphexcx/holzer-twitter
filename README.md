holzer-twitter
==============

a twitter bot written in scala dispatch and akka that tweets out Jenny Holzer truisms at set intervals

#### ABUSE OF POWER COMES AS NO SURPRISE

#### GUILT AND SELF-LACERATION ARE INDULGENCES

#### SELF-AWARENESS CAN BE CRIPPLING

#### SYMBOLS ARE MORE MEANINGFUL THAN THINGS THEMSELVES

* to see these on my twitter feed
* to contribute to Jenny Holzer's ongoing mission to display her texts in public space
